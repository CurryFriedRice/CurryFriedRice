### Strengths
1. Learning on the Fly: If there’s something that’s needed I’ll TRY to learn it
2. Organization: I personally feel more comfortable if there’s someone to report to
3. Motivational: If I find someone that has potential I get a bit more energized around that person 
4. Compassion and Peer Relationships
### Weaknesses
1. Presentation: Depending on the importance of the presentation I have to entertain the audience
2. Work Life balance: Until I get to a point where I am usually full steam at work.
3. Fear of the unknown: One new piece of information can throw a wrench in the gears
    If this happens I look back to the plan and see if it can be fit in, after all a good plan is at least a bit flexible.
4. Decision Making: Trying to figure out A or B takes a toll on me sometimes resulting in decision paralysis
    Sometimes I get bogged down with “what’s the best way to do this” and i’m working more on “here’s a plan to get it done” I can revise it at a later time

# Narrative

Q: Why did you decide to attend a coding boot camp? How does this decision reflect your values and strengths?

A: Personally I tried and tried on my own… and I can’t do anymore on my own. I needed help. I wanted to learn more. I wasn’t going to but was prompted into it from an external source.

Q: Briefly describe your past professional pursuits, educational history and personal passions and interests. How do your professional pursuits, education, interests and passions reflect your values and strengths?

A: I went to College at the UW, and got a design degree. On the college campus my cohort shied away from learning HOW to do things literally and were more philosophical about it eventually leading to me to be the one who actually went about the practice of education. The team I was on for the final project self destructed and I had to pull everyone back together and carry the project to the finish line. That project was a VR Relaxation Experience.
I went on to be a tester at microsoft. I loved working with all of them and encouraging/motivating the team on the daily. They were amazing people. Though there wasn’t any opportunity for growth, I wanted to expand my knowledge and, yes it sounds dumb, to work on the same level as them. I felt like I wasn’t an equal there, while my coworkers gave me a generous send off for some reason I didn’t feel like it was worth the time or energy. 

Q: Given your two above responses, what are the connections between your past professional pursuits, education, interests and passions, and your new career as a software engineer (or the associated career path of your choice)?

A: They are a continuation of that. I seek help to learn more so that I can stand together with them. I know I will do what needs to be done.

Q: What was the first moment you considered software engineering (or the career track of your choice)? What obstacles did you overcome to pursue this career?

A: I considered it in college. I pushed for it and was rejected. With that my sense of self broke and what was left loose was a demon of dread. I worked hard to overcome myself. I started self education, attempting to find work, and being rejected again, it started all over. Here I am again, Trying to educate myself to really find work and all I can really say is WILL work out.

Q: What do you love about the actual work of coding? How does this reflect your values and strengths?

A: To me personally it ebbs and flows. Sometimes I really enjoy the organization and beauty of the structure. Othertimes the chaotic out of the box solutions that I never would have considered. I’ve seldom worked on coding projects with others before. I enjoyed it; the collaboration, the communication, to see their thoughts throughout the problems.

Q: Given your values, strengths, and personal and professional history, what kind of work do you want to do upon completing the program? What sort of impact do you want to have?

A: I know I won’t be the one changing the world through my code. So let’s be real a bit. I want to present and organize information so that other developers can access it and deliver it to end users. Or be the one that is presenting the information in a fair unbiased light. 

I know that I won't be the one changing the world through my code. So let's be real for a bit. I want to create solutions that enrich a user's experience when using an application.

# Elevator Pitch

I am a full stack developer that is well versed in Python and C# and I enjoy chipping away at problems to reveal a solution. 

## What makes you unique and how does your past reflect that?

Example: “I’m a really creative person and I love to build things with my hands. I have 5 years experience in sales but decided to make a career transition in order to pursue opportunities in tech where I can exercise my creativity. I recently completed an intensive 14 week coding boot camp, which helped me to enhance my knowledge of full stack software development. I’m really looking forward to joining a dynamic, collaborative team where I can share my skills and knowledge of 3 different software languages.”
```
From my experience as a designer, I seldom approach a problem head on unless I am confident that I can cleanly execute without issue. I’ll chart a course of action step by step and then fill each part out one at a time to ensure that it functions. After a 14 week coding bootcamp I am confident in my ability to navigate around and through problems to find solutions. I’m really looking forward to joining a coordinated team where I can share my wealth of skills and knowledge in software development
```
# What do you want to do in the future?

Example: “Though I’m comfortable in all phases of development, I love using my experience in sales and customer service to interact with people, so I really enjoy the customer-facing aspect of front-end development. I’m looking for a mission-driven company that is working on innovative new products and services, and that shares my value for creating a positive social impact.”
```
Though I am comfortable in all phases of development, I love building out ways that the users can interact with the data they are shown. I enjoy seeing what a customer can do when they are given the appropriate tools to access data. I’m looking for a company that shares my interest in data analysis and presentation
```
# Reflection
As you look over your elevator pitch, does it effectively represent your strengths and values? Does it establish the throughlines that connect your past to present? Does it effectively portray your passions and how those passions relate to being a software engineer? 

Personally, It shows that I am a test driven developer. My decision paralysis is most likely to do with the sheer amount of data and what I could do with it. 
Personality vs BIG 5 vs strengths and weakness it sort of matches. A thinking, commander, strategist, deliverer and winner. Winner is an odd one but I do get satisfaction from chipping away at problems. While the other 4 match almost perfectly with how I create solutions.
